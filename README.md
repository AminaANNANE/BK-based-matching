# BK-based-matching
The file "AMLOntologies_Extracted mappings.rar" contains alignment files produced by YAM++ ontology matching system. These alignments concern the ontologies preselected by AML ontology matching system to use as background knowledge....(1)

In the same way, the file "LogMapBioOntologies_Extracted Mappings.rar" contains alignment files produced by YAM++ ontology matching system. These alignments concern the ontologies selected by LogMapBio ontology matching system during the OAEI 2016 competition....(2) 

We used the two sets of alignments (1) and (2) to build respectively two BK: BK1 and BK2

The files "Candidate mappings derived from BK2 the BK built from LogMapBioOntologies.rar" and "Candidate mappings derived from BK1 the BK built from AMLOntologies.rar" contain two kinds of file:
  _ CSV files that contain the candidate mappings
  _ Weka files that contain the features computed for each candidate mapping of the same line number
